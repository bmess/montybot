TODO:
* make this a real app
* docs
* testing
* make the different bots plugins

HOW TO USE:
* In the shell, run:
: $ "python bot.py <server[:port]> <channel> <bot nick> [if using link log: True]
* If you want to use the link log, your last arg should be "True"
* To use Puppy Bot you need a Flickr API key. Currently the group used is corgis but you can change that, obviously (though why would you want to?)

REQUIREMENTS:
* Twisted and its dependencies
* flickrpy
* requests
* BeautifulSoup

For PuppyBot:
* flickrpy (included here as flickr.py; source https://code.google.com/p/flickrpy/)
* flickr API key (store in secret_settings.py as API_KEY and API_SECRET)

For Link log:
* python-requests [python-requests.org]
* BeautifulSoup
* Create an empty text file, called 'links_in_channel.txt', in the same directory as the app.
