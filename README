TODO
====
* make this a real app
* docs
* testing
* make the different bots plugins

HOW TO USE
==========
* In the shell, run:
: $ "python event.py "<channel>"
* To use Puppy Bot you need a Flickr API key. Currently the group used is corgis but you can change that, obviously (though why would you want to?)

REQUIREMENTS
============

* headers (``apt-get install python-dev``)

* Twisted and its dependencies
* flickrpy
* python-requests
* BeautifulSoup

For PuppyBot::
    * flickrpy (included here as flickr.py because I patched it slightly; source https://code.google.com/p/flickrpy/)
    * flickr API key (store in secret_settings.py as API_KEY and API_SECRET; see SAMPLE file included here)

For Link log::
    * python-requests [python-requests.org]
    * BeautifulSoup
    * Create an empty text file, called 'links_in_channel.txt', in the same directory as the app.
